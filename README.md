### Assignment Overview

#### The formula for converting between fahrenheit and celsius is to: first subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9. Your exercise is to write the the following in Python.

1. Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Save this to a variable called `celsius_100`, and use `print()` to print out the value
    * Is the resulting temperature you get an integer or float? How do you know?
2. Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Save this to a variable called `celsius_0`, and use `print()` to print out the value
3. Convert a temperature of 34.2 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
    * Do this one all in one print statement **without** saving any variables


#### Now, can you convert back?

4. Convert a temperature of 5 degrees celsius to fahrenheit
5. What is hotter, a temperature of 30.2 degrees celsius, or a temperature of 85.1 degrees fahrenheit?


Follow these instructions in `temp_conversion.py` to convert temperatures between celsius and fahrenheit, then print them out.

## Summary

0. Accept the exercise via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in `temp_conversion.py` (the only `.py` file that is not a `_test.py` file)
   - Make sure to run your code often to see what changes you're making, with your computer's version of `python3 temp_conversion.py` in your terminal
3. Run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest temp_conversion_test.py` to see if your code works as expected
4. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code, and look for the little green check mark on your repo that tells you your tests passed

You're all set to begin your first coding exercise!
